     * Challenge:
     * 3) Render an instance of the "RegularButton" component right below the p element. 
     *   The button should receive "handleClick" as a prop and its content should be "Play again".
     *  
     * 4) Play a game and when you've finished, click the "Play again" button to check that everything is working.
     *    Clicking the button should make the previous game disappear and instead make the "Form" component render again.
     * 
     * ðŸ’¡ Hint: Take a good look at the "RegularButton" and the "Form" components if you're unsure of how to use the "RegularButton" component here.
